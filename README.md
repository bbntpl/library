# library

A library app that allows you to send book query in an array. The purpose of this project is to increase my experience with array and object methods such as filtering an object using a specific property value, looping through array of objects, keyword filter, and sorting the objects with a specfic property on either ascending or descending. The code mostly includes DOM element instances and playing with methods to change their properties or by appending/deleting child nodes.
